Growth mindset, to me, applies to everyday life. Being able to process new information and use that information to further your aspect and output in society. :grinning:

**My top 3 growth mindset reminders**
1. Remind myself daily that there's more to life than what I know, 
2. Being able to recieve critisim
3. Stay inspired by others that's doing more than me and not envious.

My name is Tamara. This is my first time attempting to take a coding class. I got caught up in youtube one night watching videos about coding and software development and have been interested in learning the field every since. I look forward to learning everything I can!
